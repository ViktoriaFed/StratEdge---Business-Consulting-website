# Business Consulting website
Welcome to the basic front-end project for a business consulting website. This project was crafted using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, incorporating JQuery and Lightbox JS for enhanced functionality.

## Acknowledgement
This project was developed as part of a learning experience, following a tutorial that guided the implementation of key features and design principles. The incorporation of JQuery and Lightbox JS adds a layer of sophistication to the front-end, making it both functional and visually appealing.
